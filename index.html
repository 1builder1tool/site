							<div class="post-content">
							There are currently four things possible to buy:
							<br>Please note you must use bitcoin. I do not accept paypal for anonymization.
							<br>BTC ADDRESS: 3Ba5X3SjCNvNbZYuukJrH7sLgrBXmmhpeD
							<br><br>
							A permanent server browser message which is cycled together with many others. You can see it demonstrated by adding the server to your server list and pressing refresh a few times.
							<br>This costs $3, and will stay forever. The only rule is no ads and links, other than that your message can contain anything.<br>
							<br>Another thing that is possible to buy is a temporary server browser message for $5. The server browser message will OVERRIDE the cycled ones, and always stay visible during their duration.<br>
              <br>It is also possible to buy a custom in-game MOTD that will appear for everyone when they join in chat.<br>
							The messages in-game will be displayed upon logon in shiny yellow at the top of the chat. The only rule for the motd is that it can't be longer than 5 chat lines. If you break this rule, I will tell you by replying to your mail.
							<br>For $5, a message will be displayed for 24 hours, for $10 it will be 48 hours and so on, unless requested to be split up.<br>
							<br>The last thing possible to buy is a custom 64x64 .png image that is displayed in the server browser. You can see it the same way you see the rotating server browser messages. This custom image costs $5 per 24 hours, and the rules for it are no gore/porn/cp.<br>
							<br>To buy any of these, donate the amount required for what you want to buy by sending the money to the bitcoin address (linked above) and after donating send a message to one of the contacts on the contact page containing your bitcoin transaction id used for donating, and your messages and/or picture.<br>
							<br>You can use this format to make it easier:<br>
							Bitcoin transaction ID:
							<br>Server browser message(s):<br>
							Message of the day:
							<br><br>
							When buying $5 overriding messages, it is possible to have several rotated server browser messages as well, just request so when sending the mail.
							<br>I suggest that when purchasing any of these things that you limit yourself to not more than 5 days, this is so that everyone can have a chance at their messages and pictures displayed! If you have any ideas for donation rewards please suggest them by contacting one of the contacts with your suggestion.<br>

							If you somehow find a better alternative, do not hesitate to tell me. Although I think I've managed to find the cheapest way of hosting this, and still have great hardware and network.
							<br></br>
                            The minecraft server computer costs €34 a month. The hardware is an Intel Core i7-6700 cpu, 64 gb ram (16gb allocated to 1b1t) and 2x4tb enterprise hard drives. Additionally, we have great network. The bandwidth is 1 gigabit up and down. The server is hosted in Central Europe (Germany).
